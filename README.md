## Setup & Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **macOS or Windows** (cross-platform support)
- **Dependencies:**  
  - `fastapi`
  - `uvicorn`
  - `pygetwindow`
  - `pyautogui`
  - `mss`
  - `pydantic`
  - `pywebview`

Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Server and UI

```sh
python src/ui.py
```

- This will start the FastAPI backend and open a native desktop window to the web UI.
- The backend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- The UI is served at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ui/index.html` (not file://).
- The UI and API must be served from the same origin for full functionality.

---

## Project Structure

```
/dtop-app
  /src
    main.py         # FastAPI backend
    ui.py           # PyWebview launcher
    ...
  /ui               # Frontend HTML/JS for the UI
  requirements.txt
  README.md
  run.sh
```

---

## Notes

- **macOS:**  
  - Grant Accessibility permissions to your terminal or Python app for automation to work.
  - Some system UI windows are filtered out for a cleaner window list.
- **Window IDs:**  
  - IDs may change if you close/reopen windows. Always fetch the latest list before automating.
- **Automation:**  
  - Coordinates are absolute screen positions. Use screenshots to determine the correct values.
- **Bundled App:**  
  - The app is now bundled with PyInstaller and works correctly in both development and bundled modes.

## Contributing

- Keep code simple and DRY.
- Avoid code duplication and unnecessary mocking.
- Keep files under 200â€“300 lines; refactor as needed.
